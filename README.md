# binaryPuzzleSolver

Binary Puzzle Solver is my attempt to build a bot to play [binaary puzzle](http://binarypuzzle.com/) for me.

Just to clarify I do not have any previous knowledge of algorithmic solving (binary) soduku. Someone probably already has some genius solution for this type of problem. This bot is the translation of how I think and play the game.

Running environment: `Mac OSX Sierra`

Language: `Python 3.6.1`
